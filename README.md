### 💣Traps

### 🎁Items & Weapons


### 🌌Multi-Endings

The game doesn't show much about the backgroud story, but we tried to design the maps, items and weapons based on that (well there are some designs are just memes that we liked :p).

By picking different memory fragment in the store, an image of memory will be displayed. If there are too many bad memory, the ending would be depressing...
